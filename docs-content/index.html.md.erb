## <id="overview"></a>Overview

The a9s Consul DNS for PCF tile provides a highly available DNS service including a Consul cluster as well as additional Dnsmasq servers for service discovery and service failover procedures.

Consul is a highly available (HA) service discovery and configuration tool, which includes features such as failure detection, an HA key/value storage and an HA DNS service
that can be remotely controlled via an HTTP-based REST interface.

This service is used and required by the a9s DataService tiles for PCF like [a9s Elasticsearch for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/a9s-elasticsearch), [a9s MongoDB for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/a9s-mongodb) or [a9s PostgreSQL for PCF](https://network.pivotal.io/products/a9s-postgresql) to advertise its service
instances and service broker to the Pivotal Elastic Runtime.
